# Open a PR

- Check that I'm in a branch other than `main` or `prod`. If not, bail and explain.
- Check the diff between my branch and the main branch of the repo
- If there's unstaged or staged work that hasn't been committed, commit all the relevant code first (Use `gh` in case it's installed)
- NEVER add a `🤖 Generated with Claude Code` or similar line to description
- Write up a quick PR description in the following format

<feature_area_conventional_commits>: <lowercase_title> (80 characters or less)

<TLDR> (no more than 2 sentences)

<Description>
- 1~3 bullet points explaining what's changing

- Always paste the link to the PR in your response so I can click it easily
